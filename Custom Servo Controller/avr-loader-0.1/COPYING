  SSC-32 Open-Source Information

  The servo controller is Open Source which means we are posting the
  source code for the bootloader and firmware. The goal is to have an
  affordable platform that many people will provide firmware for. It
  should also help many aspiring programmers learn some tricks. Anyone
  can use the source code to write specialized firmware, providing you
  allow Lynxmotion, Inc. to publish it for others to enjoy, and it is
  not used in a commercial product. As it is, this servo controller
  will outperform controllers costing two or three times as
  much. Having several "flavors" of the firmware will make this an
  even better value.
